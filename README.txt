The purpose of this Git repository is to hold the work that I've done in Comp20, Web Programming.

My favorite homework was whereintheworld. It started out as the most intimidating assignment where I didn't know how to complete any of it. When I finished it, I felt that I had a firm grasp on the basics of server side development. This assignment also helped me cement my understanding of how and why the previous homeworks actually worked.

I think that this course has been very helpful to my growth. My knowledge base is much wider than it was before. Even though I don't know everything about each topic that we covered, I feel that I have a deep enough understanding to further pursue any topic on my own.

The most important thing that I learned in this course is how to find the answers to my own questions, and it is almost certain that someone has had the same question before me and has posted about it on a forum somewhere. In the redline API in A3, I really struggled with sending the data until I carefully read through an example on stack overflow and learned that you had to append chunks of data. In the semester group project, we've had to learn how to use stuff like Bootstrap and Mailgun on our own. Since we learned how to use other API's and how to do basic styling in class, we were able to independently teach ourselves these other things.

Now that I've finished the course, I would like to learn more about back end programming. I would specifically like to learn more about web security.
