Implementation:
I use the navigator.geolocation object to get my location, which I then use to retrieve the list of people. All of the students are markers with an info box and the same icon. Each character marker has an info box and their specific icon, and there is a poly line between the character marker and my marker. Below the map, the distances between me and the characters (sorted from closest to furthest) are listed in miles.

Time spent: ~6 hours
